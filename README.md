The Odin Recipe Project

This is a short, bare-bones website I created as part of the Odin Project curriculum. On this website, I have three of my favorite recipes listed, with ingredients, steps, and links to their source recipes. They're all delicious, so feel free to try one or all of them!

I have demonstrated various skills relating to Git and basic HTML in this project, including:
* Generating an HTML boilerplate from memory and automatically with `!`
* Relative and absolute links, as well as opening in a new tab and hiding your info from the site you're linking with `noopener` and `noreferrer`
* Embedding images
* Changing font styles with `<em>` and `<strong>`
* Making ordered and unordered lists
* Utilizing the Git and Github workflow (generating an SSH key, cloning a repository, `git add`, `git commit -m ""`, and `git push origin main`)

I think I have a good handle on these skills now, although I will have to practice writing more to-the-point commit messages, which I'm sure I will learn through practice on future projects.

Thanks for reading! ^_^
