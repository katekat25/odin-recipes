    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chinese Stir-Fried Tomatoes and Eggs is a simple, delicious dish that is widespread in China. A heap of scallions are fried in oil that is used to cook the eggs, which are finally topped off with a tangy-sweet tomato sauce. It all comes together in about 20 minutes, and is great served over rice (a rice cooker will speed things up greatly!)</p>
