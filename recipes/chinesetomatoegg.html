    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chinese Stir-Fried Tomatoes and Eggs is a simple, delicious dish that is widespread in China. A heap of scallions are fried in oil that is used to cook the eggs, which are finally topped off with a tangy-sweet tomato sauce. It all comes together in about 20 minutes, and is great served over rice (a rice cooker will speed things up greatly!)</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Shaoxing rice wine or dry sherry</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1 14/5oz can of diced tomatoes in juice</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons neutral oil</li>
        <li>3 scallions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced giner (from about 1/4-inch nub)</li>
    </uo>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs with the sesame oi1, rice wine/sherry, and 1 teaspoon salt. In a separate bowl, mix cornstarch and 2 tablespoons water until well combines, then stir in the sugar and ketchup.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wide skillet over high heat. When hot, add most of the scallions, saving some for garnish. Cook, stirring, until very aromatic, about 20 seconds. Add the eggs and cook, stirring well, until just set but still runny, about 45 seconds. Pour the eggs back into the bowl and wipe out the pan.</li>
        <li>Reheat the pan over high heat with the remaining tablespoon of oil. When hot, add the ginger and cook until aromatic, about 15 seconds. Add the tomatoes and salt them to taste. Cook, stirring occasionally until the flesh has softened but still has some shape and the juices have begun to form a sauce, about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Stir the cornstarch-ketchup mixture to reconstitute it, then stir it into the pan. Cook, stirring, until the sauce returns to a boil and thickens. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, sugar, or more ketchup. Return the eggs to the pan, cutting them up a bit with the spatula, and cook, stirring, for a few seconds to finish cooking the eggs and to combine. Top with the reserved scallions, and serve with steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
