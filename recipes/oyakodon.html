    <h1>Oyakodon (Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl)</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is another go-to recipe of mine for busy weekdays involving quick preparation and simple ingredients. "Donburi," or <em>rice bowl meals</em>, were one of my first introductions to Japanese cooking, and I love their simplicity. Make sure you put on a pot of high-quality short-grain rice and when it's all ready, pour a little extra sauce onto your bowl. You won't regret it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 onion, peeled and sliced lengthwise</li>
        <li>10 oz boneless skinless chicken thighs, trimmed and cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sake</li>
        <li>3-4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dashi*</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>Cooked rice</li>
        <li>Green onions, finely chopped, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*<em>Tip: Dashi is Japanese soup stock. You can buy it in powder or packet form at Asian grocery stores or online. Or you can, <a href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-make-dashi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make your own</a>.</em></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine dashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar in a bowl or liquid measuring cup and mix until the sugar is dissolved.</li>
        <li>On a tray, combine chicken and sake. Set aside for 5 minutes to marinate.</li>
        <li>Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk briefly and gently until yolks are just broken and whites are "cut," forming a marble pattern. Do not beat the eggs!</li>
        <li>With heat off, add onions and liquid mixture into a pan. Turn heat to medium low and simmer. Once simmering, add chicken on top of the onions. Cook uncovered for 5 minutes or until chicken is no longer pink and onions are tender, flipping the chicken halfway through.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to medium. Drizzle the eggs in a circular pattern over the chicken and onions, avoiding the edges of the pan (the eggs will overcook). Cook until the eggs are still runny but just set.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice topped with chopped green onions, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
