    <h1>Oyakodon (Chicken and Egg Rice Bowl)</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is another go-to recipe of mine for busy weekdays involving quick preparation and simple ingredients. "Donburi," or <em>rice bowl meals</em>, were one of my first introductions to Japanese cooking, and I love their simplicity. Make sure you put on a pot of high-quality short-grain rice and when it's all ready, pour a little extra sauce onto your bowl. You won't regret it.</p>
